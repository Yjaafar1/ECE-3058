Problem 1B
----------

The total ex. time seems to be logarithmic, with smaller returns on efficiency when
using 4 cores. This likely has to do with the fact that not all cores are being used
at a time, with numerous idles interjected. With a modern CPU where far more processes demand
CPU cores at once, the benefit of having more cores would be more noticable, but for this simulation
there is a much smaller difference between 2 and 4 cores.
